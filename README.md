# NeuDark
**neuDark** is an eye-saver modification of the Stylish and Stylus Admin interface for Chrome. The interface is completely re-designed for a dark experience, incorporating Font Awesome icons and a semi-material theme. **NeuDark** currently supports all of the dark syntax themes shipped with both platforms and will support light-to-dark theme conversions in the future. If you enjoy this theme please consider [buying me a beer][1].
